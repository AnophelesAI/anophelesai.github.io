        <div id="segment"><p>Malaria is an infectious disease which continues to pose a great challenge in healthcare. According to the United Nations Children’s Fund [UNICEF] (2022), every seventy-five seconds, a child under five dies of malaria. In addition, research shows that close to half of the world’s population was at risk of contracting malaria in 2021 (World Health Organisation [WHO], 2022). </p>
            <p>Further research shows that between the years of 2021 and 2022, four African countries: Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the United Republic of Tanzania and Niger, accounted for slightly more than half of the recorded malaria mortalities globally (WHO, 2022). Our goal is to help preliminarily diagnose persons who are sick with malaria, aiding quicker decision-making towards treatment, patient monitoring and care, leading to a more reliable healthcare system. </p>
            <p>The expert system operates by using a forward-chaining and rule-based inference procedure to generate a result. In order to use this expert system and receive a diagnosis, the user will be required to input relevant symptoms.</p>
